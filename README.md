ChitChat Final Year Project for BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application)
a fresh Flutter endeavour.

Flutter and Dart were used in the creation of this project, and the Firebase console was used for authentication.
You can update your profile and talk with random people on the server who have registered using this application.
Using Gmail or Apple ID, you can register for an account.

The application uses the internet to function.
The application will notify you automatically if your internet is down.
I will soon include neighbouring events, a chronology, and reviews for specific individuals.

My talking application has both stateless and statefull widgets, and it has a lot of potential in the future.

With more users worldwide than traditional social networks, messaging apps will have a bigger impact on the dissemination of digital news in the future.

Resources, concepts, packages, responsive applications, user interfaces, authentication, and real-time data storage are all included in the SDLC.

I'm included the references and the summary.

I've included a brief explanation video so you can see how my chat programme functions.
