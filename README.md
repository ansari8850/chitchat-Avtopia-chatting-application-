ChitChat Final Year Project for BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application)
a fresh Flutter endeavour.

Flutter and Dart were used in the creation of this project, and the Firebase console was used for authentication.
You can update your profile and talk with random people on the server who have registered using this application.
Using Gmail or Apple ID, you can register for an account.

My talking application has both stateless and statefull widgets, and it has a lot of potential in the future.

Resources, concepts, packages, responsive applications, user interfaces, authentication, and real-time data storage are all included in the SDLC.

| Element   | Description   |

|Dart|Responsive|

I've included a brief explanation video so you can see how my chat programme functions.
